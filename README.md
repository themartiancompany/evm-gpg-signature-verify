# EVM GNU Privacy Guard Signature Verifier

The EVM GNU Privacy Guard Signature Verifier
tool checks if a file is cryptographically signed
by an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain
network user using one of its
[EVM OpenPGP Key Server](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-openpgp-keyserver)
self-published keys.

The EVM GNU Privacy Guard Signature Verifier
tool is written using the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
library.

It uses
[GPG Signature Info](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/gpg-signature-info)
to read the fingerprint which has been used to sign the
file and
[GPG Signature Verify](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/gpg-signature-verify)
to check whether the file has been signed with one
of the Key Server keys.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

or even run directly

```bash
bash \
  gpg-signature-verify/gpg-signature-verify
```

The tool has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-signature-verify`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  gpg-signature-verify
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[gpg-signature-verify-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/gpg-signature-verify-ur).

A censorable binary package has been published on the
[Fallback User Repository](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/fur)
and it can be installed with

```bash
fur \
  gpg-signature-verify
```

Be aware the mirrors could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
